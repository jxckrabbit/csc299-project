I frankly refuse to use AI unless I absolutely have to, so these are my HUMAN ideas for a task management system that might be useful for me. 
  1. A system that separates academic/work tasks from home management and recreational tasks, as looking at both at once can overwhelm me.
    1a. Said system could also tell the user when they are "neglecting" a certain category, i.e. If you're procrastinating on your homework it'll tell you to do it or if you're neglecting your house it'll tell you to clean
  2. A task "splitter" that could take a large general task and split it into more manageable pieces based on gathered data of what that large task would likely contain
    2a. So if you were cleaning your house it would split that task into smaller ones that you could rest in-between. Same idea with homework tasks.

If I do any prototyping they'll be included later:
